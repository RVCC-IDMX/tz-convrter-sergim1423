# TimeZone Converter

## This app, takes an input from the user and returns the timezone in two different ways

## First way is unformated, where it doesnt look the best

## But if you type your input + --format it will make the conversion neater and easier to read.

# !!In order to Start the app!!

## Input a valid place/location, or else it will return nothing.

## Next step would be to look at the data being given. If the formating is confusing for you

## Type your desired location like this to make it formated, location --format

## Typing it like that will make it look much better.
